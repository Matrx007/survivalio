My first attempt at WebGL &amp; TypeScript  
  
*Most of the progress is in the `dev` branch.*  
  
## Current state  
This project was abandoned because the performance was far worse than I was hoping to achieve with WebGL in the browser. I will probably reattempt this project eventually, but right now I'm more into web apps than web games.

I also tried [p5](https://p5js.org) and [PixiJS](https://www.pixijs.com). If I ever wanted to reattempted this project, I would give [D3.js](https://d3js.org) a try.
